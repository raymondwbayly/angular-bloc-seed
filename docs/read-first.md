# Working with the SEED

----------
## What is a bloc ?
A bloc is a site area allowing you to package multiple views within an area to deliver it to the site, an area could be a store or a user area , but the architecture of the seed is built upon the bloc architecture.

Creating a new Bloc

1. Create a folder under ```/src``` calling it your bloc name ```name.bloc```
2. populate it with the files from the example.bloc and edit it to create a new bloc (new module and component name)
3. Add the bloc to the ```/src/app/app.routes``` using the example in the routes file to know how and you are off and running.
